# This is an example file that demonstrates how to specify storage-to-search type mappings beyond
# those embedded in the type transformation files (in the storage-type and storage-object-type
# parameters).

# Type mappings specified in a mappings file override any equivalent mappings in the type
# transformation files. If no type mappings exist for the transformation files, the latest
# version of the parsing rules embedded in the file is used.

# Type mappings can be split or combined among files as desired, except that only one storage
# type can be specified per mapping file.

# Currently only YAML-compatible files are supported for type mappings.

# specify the storage type (e.g. the source of the data)
storage-type: WS

# specify the types included in this mapping file. The search types given must match with
# the global-object-type key in the type transformation file.
types:
    # A simple mapping that is a map from the storage object type to the search type(s).
